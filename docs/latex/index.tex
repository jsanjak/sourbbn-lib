Bayesian Belief Networks (B\+B\+Ns) are a type of probabilistic graphical model where the joint distribution over all variables in the model is represented by directed acyclic graph. Nodes in the graph represent the probability distribution of a given variable conditional on it\textquotesingle{}s parents in the graph. These conditional distributions are stored as conditional probability tables. The values in conditional probability tables are often inferred from data and are not known exactly. This library provides a set of C/\+C++ classes and functions implementing the Mean\+Var and Buck\+Elim+ algorithms, extracted from \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2007.09.004}{\tt Van Allen et al. 2008}, for querying B\+B\+Ns with uncertain data.
